Open your ssh client or terminal if you are using Linux.
Locate your private key file and change your directory.
cd <path to your .pem file>
Execute below commands:
chmod 400 <filename>.pem
ssh -i <filename>.pem ubuntu@<ipaddress.com>
If ubuntu user is not working then try with ec2-user.



chmod 600 ec2-keypair.pem
ssh -v -i ec2-keypair.pem ubuntu@ec2-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Step 1: log in to ec2 using your .pem key
Step 2: create two files 1. "touch /home/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa" 2. "touch /home/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
Step 3: "cat /home/user-name/.ssh/authorized_keys >> /home/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
Step 4: "cat /your-private-key.pem >> /home/user-name/.ssh/id_rsa"
id_rsa is the private key in which you need to copy the contents of .pem file. You can do this by bringing your .pem file on master node using WinSCP or other tools.

Also change the file permissions of both id_rsa , id_rsa.pub to "chmod 600 id_rsa" "chmod 600 id_rsa.pub"



Make sure you are in the same directory where you have your .pem file.

use command, chmod 0400 example.pem

then use command, ssh -i example.pem ec2-user@YOUR-IP


$ puttygen keyfile.pem -O private -o avdev.ppk



ssh-add ~/.ssh/KEY_PAIR_NAME.pem
ssh user_name@<instance public dns/ip>



Get your .pem that was generated when you first made the EC2 instance.
Convert the .pem file .ppk using PuttyGen since PuTTY does not read .pem.
Open PuTTY and enter your Host Name which is your instance username + Public DNS (Ex. ubuntu@ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.region.compute.amazonaws.com). Not your AWS account username.
Then navigate to Connection > SSH > Auth. Then add your .ppk file. Click on Browse where it says "Private key file for authentication".
Click Open and you should be able to immediately establish connection.




Following are the simple steps for Linux user to connect with the server using .pem file:

Step1: To to the location of pem file and copy it to home .ssh location.

cp example.pem ~/.ssh/example.pem
Step2: Change the permission

chmod 400 ~/.ssh/example.pem
Step3: Run the following command

ssh -i ~/.ssh/example.pem ec2-user@host.com
As this command is too long so you sould create the alias of this using following commands:

 vim ~/.bashrc
Write the same command in the following manner at the last.

alias sshConnect='ssh -i ~/.ssh/example.pem ec2-user@host.com'
Now restart your system and use sshConnect to connect with your server.



ssh -i /home/Downloads/your_key_name.pem
